# predict-customer-churn-rate

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as 
the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. It is also the rate at which employees leave their jobs within a certain 
period. For a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate (measured by the number of new customers) must exceed its churn rate.
